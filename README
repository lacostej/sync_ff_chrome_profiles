Very dirty import of FF passwords into chrome.

Tested on Linux Ubuntu 9.04 with:
* chromium 4.0.222.1 (Ubuntu build 28248)
* Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5pre) Gecko/20091007 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Shiretoko/3.5.5pre

[Limitations]
* doesn't deal with user blocked sites
* doesn't fully import some fields (form fields, timestamps, preferred, etc...)
* doesn't check for duplicates before writting...
* doesn't automatically backups nor overwrites profile file
